# Smile Detector using Deep Neural Network

Smile Detector Project using Deep Neural Network is a simple implementation of DNN on Emoji faces of happy and sad. We will read the emojis from images and train them on our DNN. Later we use the trained model to predict whether the face image provided is happy or sad. For this we are going to use 10 happy faces and 10 sad faces for training, and one from each category for testing.

The steps followed in this mini-project are:
1. Importing the necessary packages
2. Reading the images from directory and converting them into Features and Labels.
3. Applying Min-Max Normalization on Features
4. Creating a DNN Model for training and testing the data
5. Compiling the Model
6. Training the Model
7. Evaluating the Model on Test Data
8. Making predictions using Test Data
